# Gemini Bringup

This repository contains the electronic design files for the Gemini Bringup
board. This board contains some of the moving parts of the final Gemini system,
but laid out in a way that is easier to probe and test.

This is a KiCad project; you will need KiCad (preferably 5.1.2) to participate.
Additionally, you will need the symbol and footprint libraries in the
submodules; you can obtain these by doing either of:

	`$ git clone --recursive`

when your first clone this repository, or

	`$ git submodule update --init`

after cloning or syncing up.  If you leave out this step, KiCad will complain
loudly about missing symbols and/or footprints and attemot to "rescue" them,
which will create spurious changes to your copy of the repo and prevent
subsequent pull/rebase/merge/push operations from working as desired.
