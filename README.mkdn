# Gemini Bringup

This repository contains the electronic design files for the Gemini Bringup
board. This board contains some of the moving parts of the final Gemini system,
but laid out in a way that is easier to probe and test.

This is a KiCad project; you will need KiCad (preferably 5.1.2) to participate.
