# Gemini Bringup

This repository contains the electronic design files for the Gemini Bringup
board. This board contains some of the moving parts of the final Gemini system,
but laid out in a way that is easier to probe and test.

This is a KiCad project; you will need KiCad (preferably 5.1.2) to participate.
Additionally, you will need the symbol and footprint libraries in the
submodules; you can obtain these by doing either of:

	`$ git clone --recursive`

when your first clone this repository, or

	`$ git submodule update --init`

after cloning or syncing up.  If you leave out this step, KiCad will complain
loudly about missing symbols and/or footprints and attemot to "rescue" them,
which will create spurious changes to your copy of the repo and prevent
subsequent pull/rebase/merge/push operations from working as desired.


# Shopping list

The following items are included with the initial kit; if you are building one
of these later you will need to acquire them on your own.

- A power supply (should have been included, we bought a batch, but if you have
  to go out on your own: 12V 2+A depending on how many fans you want to run;
  5.5mm OD / 2.1mm ID barrel)

You will need to separately acquire the following to be able to program all the
micros:

- A SWD tool that can program the STM32H7.
  - [STLink V3](https://www.amazon.com/STLINK-V3-Modular-Circuit-debugger-Programmer/dp/B07KPMK8VX/)
    is the nicest but will only talk to ST parts. We're trying to standardize on
    this.
  - [STLink V2](https://www.amazon.com/Microcontrollers-circuit-debugger-programmer-emulator/dp/B00C7WDTLG/)
    in a pinch, e.g. if the V3 is unavailable. Needs an adapter from the
    old-style 20pin connector to the modern 10pin connector, something like
    [this](https://www.amazon.com/ARM-JTAG-20-10-ARM-Micro-JTAG-adapter/dp/B009UEO9ZY).

- A USB-to-TTL-serial adapter, ideally one ending in loose Dupont wires so it
  doesn't have a fixed pinout. You will use this for flashing the LPC55 on the
  RoT carrier, at least the first time. If you don't already have one, we have
  10 of them we can distribute.

Depending on your development goals you may also need:

- A SWD tool that can program the LPC55S. The answer here is much less clear
  and you can skip it for now if you're mostly doing SP work.
  - The [MCU-Link](https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/lpcxpresso-boards/jtag-swd-debug-probe:MCU-LINK)
    works for flashing but not log/test output. We may be able to make it work
    later.
  - NXP's previous-gen LPC-Link2 board will also work w/o log/test output if you
    can still find it.
  - In practice we are mostly using the LPC55Sxpresso board with a soldered-on
    header and a hack.

- A logic analyzer is never a _bad_ idea if you're doing driver development. We
  like the Saleae Logic.

# Handling

Handle the board by its edges if possible.

This board is not well-defended against static discharge. Please try not to zap
the exposed pins. For best results, use the board in a static-safe workspace,
ideally elevated on standoffs in the corner holes (which we forgot to include in
your kit, sorry). It will work OK on a non-staticky desk surface, too, as long
as you bring yourself and the board to a similar electrical potential before
touching exposed metal bits. Touching the Ethernet plug jacks is an OK place to
ground, they are somewhat better isolated than the rest of the exposed pins.

# Getting Started

If you have a pre-validated board, it should already have firmware on it. To
check that things still kinda work:

1. Unpack the base board and the RoT carrier board from their antistatic bags,
   handling carefully.

2. Attach the RoT to the base board, if you want to test the RoT. It goes in the
   northwest corner of the base board, only fits one way, and makes a satisfying
   *click* when it is fully seated.

3. Plug in the included power supply. (The connector is at the northeast
   corner.)

You should get two blinking lights, one directly northwest of the big central
ARM chip (the SP) and one just south of the RoT carrier board.

To build and program your own firmware, you will need to have followed the
toolchain setup instructions in [the Hubris repo](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris/).
We don't yet have a dedicated firmware image for the RoT, and have been running
hacked versions of a demo app on it, so instead, here are instructions for
building and flashing the SP.

1. Disconnect power before plugging/unplugging anything.

2. Plug in the skinny 10-pin ribbon cable from your STLink V3 to connector J301,
   which is to the northeast of the SP and is labeled "BRICK SP" because that's
   what you can do with it.  (Some STLink's have a 14-pin STDC14 ribbon cable.
   That works here, too.)

3. Plug the other end into your STLink V3.

4. Reconnect power to the board.

5. In the Hubris repository, run: `cargo xtask flash gemini-bu/app.toml`

6. Relax. On a first build this may take several minutes.

7. A successful build-and-flash will end in something that looks like an error
   message (sorry). Scan up a few lines for the phrase `** Verified OK**`. If
   that appears, you're good, and the lights should be blinking by the SP.
