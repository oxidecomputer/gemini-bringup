### J301 SP Debug

See J202 for pinout.

Pin 1 **Southwest.**

### J302 SP SERIAL TO HOST

This is a **RS232-level** serial connector designed to mate with Ethanol-X. If
you plug in a standard TTL-level USB-to-serial converter, it will probably not
work and may be damaged. You have been warned.

Pin 1 **Southwest.**

This connector uses a truly ancient pinout used for the internal serial port
connectors on pre-AT PCs, called the "Intel/DTK" pinout.

These connectors break out U501, an LTC4306GCN I2C Mux.

They are referenced to the remote voltage provided on pin 1 -- they do not
produce power for external devices.

1. 2.2V - 5.5V reference voltage input.
2. SCL
3. GND
4. SDA
5. /SMBA
6. GND

### J701, J702, J703, J704, J705, J706 FANS FANS FANS

Pin 1 **South**.

Fans use a pinout from Dell servers because the PC-style fan connectors are
_really hard to find._ Converter pigtails available on Amazon.

translator, so that it can be connected to a 1v8 host QuadSPI circuit.

### J1101 SP I2C4 D

Pin 1 **West.**

```
+-------------+
| 1 2 3 4 5 6 |
+---+     +---+
    +-----+
```

This is a voltage-translated SMBus connector that can operate at 1.65V to 3.6V,
but the reference voltage must be supplied from off-board onto pin1.
(Alternatively, you can jumper pin1 to a 3v3 source onboard using a Dupoint lead.)

No external pullups on the I2C lines are required (and providing them may mess
things up).

1. 1.65V - 3.6V in for voltage translator
2. SP I2C4 SCL on PD12
3. GND
4. SP I2C4 SDA on PD13
5. /SMBA (SP PD11)
6. GND

### J1401 HOST SPI TAKEOVER

This provides an SP SPI controller on a voltage-translated Dediprog pinout,
intended to be compatible with the SPI Dediprog header on Ethanol-X as a
lower-bandwidth way of taking over its SPI ROM.

Pin 1 **Northeast.**

7. NC
8. GND
